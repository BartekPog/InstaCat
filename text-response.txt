    "output": "Oh god I just love this cat. The Cat is soo cute. The kitten is blissfully easy to poop into a ball.\n\nThe first thing that makes it different, I said, is that the cat was more \"diverse\" than I know. This is a good thing. I love having a cat. I also love that just I knew this cat without the expectation that I'd get killed for this cat. The cat's life has always been special instead of special and so I have no doubt that I am in love with this cat.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to say to the cats as I got closer was a joke that I found a nice cat on Facebook \u2013 although \"Uncle\" is the abbreviation for \"cat person.\"\n\nI am pretty sure that even the cats in the wild will prove popular.\n\nAdvertisements<|endoftext|>A little over two days ago the New York Times reported on President Trump's claim: \"In one speech, he said the only way to defeat ISIS was a strongman in the Middle East \u2013 a tough guy\"\n\n\"And that was a call from me that he made to his friends in Iraq,\" Trump said.\n\nThis was a very serious moment for the Times after Trump spent a half-hour talking about his father's vision for America. He explained that the idea of a weak nation was nothing different than the idea of the American people in Iraq \u2013 a concept that the Obama administration and now Trump are using to justify war.\n\nOn the day he began the campaign, he talked about taking in a bunch of Iraq \"stupid politicians\" who are \"all in business\" about the same thing.\n\nA few minutes later, the Times published an article in which Trump appeared to describe what he termed a \"national disaster\" \u2013 a \"nation of people living in fear of losing their jobs or losing their homes.\" As if the nation were collapsing in a crisis.\n\nThis, in fact, may not be the worst moment in the Trump presidency, but it's significant nonetheless.\n\nHe talked about the fact that American citizens will be given \"a greater and more nuanced narrative about how the United States in the future will go about its business,\" arguing that it is \"just another form of warfare\" that \"has nothing to do with global threats to the United States.\"\n\nThe Times also went for a \"very, very hard-line\" statement that would not only \"be applauded\" by Trump but \"revealed, as a presidential candidate, the danger of an authoritarian government\" \u2013 that the United States is in peril, possibly.\n\nHe did, however, go after President Trump's favorite line of attack \u2013 that he has absolutely zero tolerance for the idea of invading the country.\n\nAs President Trump stated in the Times:\n\nOur enemies are in our Country. Our enemies are in our People. But it is up to me \u2013 the president of the United States \u2013 to use the military to take them down. I just announced. (PRESIDENT-EYED) Goodbye. (PRESIDENT-EYED) Goodbye. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017\n\nThe idea that we have a nation-state and America is a strong country and proud of what our enemies do today is ridiculous. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017\n\n\"The problem with this country is that we have a president who has the courage to say the only way to defeat ISIS is a strongman in the Middle East \u2013 astrongman in the Middle East,\" Trump reportedly said according to a transcript from Time magazine. \"You know, I was just asked by ... 'what do you think of an American president?' ... He said, 'It's probably a nice compliment but ... I love my country.' \"\n\nTrump also took to the Sunday Times: \"I was not really thinking when I said the president, because I was thinking, you know, in terms of this country. And he was talking about how great the country was but I was thinking about it when the president said. ... That ... is all-out attack, and the way we've been going from the Middle East to the South and to Europe is a very tough combination for ISIS.\"\n\nSo Trump has now taken to calling out the president for this kind of aggression \u2013 a word that is a euphemism for war.\n\nThis is just a few short years after a president could tell George W. Bush that Americans cannot protect their country when one foreign nation was invaded \u2013 but the same president has now taken to calling out an authoritarian government.<|endoftext|>A team of physicists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Institute of Physics at MIT have designed a quantum computer that allows scientists to make, for example, a quantum \"tunnel\" of a quantum system.\n\nThe idea is that quantum computing is capable of making predictions across multiple ways \u2014 such as predicting the strength of a superposition. The computer would be an important factor in understanding whether human brains can predict the shape of the universe.<|endoftext|>(Photo via Wikimedia",
